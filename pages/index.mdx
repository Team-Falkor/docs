# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Falkor!

## What is Falkor?

Falkor is an open-source launcher that allows you to browse games, explore upcoming releases, and find the best deals with built-in IsThereAnyDeal integration to compare prices (please note, purchases are made through your default browser, not within the app). Designed to be flexible and expandable, Falkorâ€™s core functionality is enhanced by community-created providers, giving users the power to customize and extend the app in countless ways.

## What platforms will Falkor support?

Falkor is being developed with cross-platform support in mind, including Windows and Linux. Stay tuned for updates as we work on releases for these platforms.

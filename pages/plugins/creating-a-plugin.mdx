# Creating a Plugin

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a plugin for Falkor. Plugins can be written in any language, as they are simply APIs that serve JSON data.

## Prerequisites

To create a plugin, you need to use a language capable of serving JSON data. While we recommend using Node.js, you are free to use any language you're comfortable with.

## Required Routes

For a plugin to work, the following routes are required:

- `/setup.json`
- `/search/:os/:query`

### `setup.json`

The `setup.json` file is used to configure the plugin. It contains the following fields:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the plugin.
- `version`: The version of the plugin, used to determine compatibility.
- `config`: A boolean indicating whether the plugin has a configuration page. If true, the plugin will appear in the settings menu.
- `multiple-choice`: A boolean indicating whether the plugin supports multiple games. If true, additional requests may be needed to fetch source links.
- `name`: The name of the plugin, displayed in the settings menu.
- `description`: A description of the plugin, shown in the settings menu.
- `logo`: A URL to the plugin's logo, displayed in the settings menu.
- `banner`: A URL to the plugin's banner, displayed in the settings menu. (Optional)
- `api_url`: The base URL for the plugin's API, used for making requests.
- `author`: Information about the author of the plugin. (Optional)

### Example `setup.json`

```json
{
  "id": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "config": true,
  "multiple-choice": false,
  "name": "Example Plugin",
  "description": "This is an example plugin.",
  "logo": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "banner": "https://example.com/banner.png",
  "api_url": "https://example.com/api",
  "author": {
    "name": "example",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

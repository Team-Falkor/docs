# Creating a plugin

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a plugin for Falkor. The plugins can be made in any language, as they are just apis that serve json data.

## Creating a plugin

To create a plugin you need to use a language that can serve json data. We recommend using Node.js, but you can use any language you want.

## Needed Routes

The following routes are needed for a plugin to work:

- `/setup.json`
- `/search/:os/:query`

### Setup.json

The setup.json file is used to configure the plugin. It contains the following fields:

- `id`: The id of the plugin. This is used to identify the plugin and should be unique.
- `version`: The version of the plugin. This is used to determine compatibility with the plugin.
- `config`: Whether the plugin has a configuration page. This is used to determine whether the plugin should be displayed in the settings menu.
- `multiple-choice`: Whether the plugin supports multiple games. This is used to determine whether the plugin needs another request to get the source links
- `name`: The name of the plugin. This is used to display the plugin in the settings menu.
- `description`: A description of the plugin. This is used to display the plugin in the settings menu.
- `logo`: The logo of the plugin. This is used to display the plugin in the settings menu.
- `banner`: The banner of the plugin. This is used to display the plugin in the settings menu. (optional)
- `api_url`: The url of the api of the plugin. This is used to make requests to the plugin.
- `author`: The author of the plugin. This is used to display the plugin in the settings menu. (optional)

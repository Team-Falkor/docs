# Creating a Plugin

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a plugin for Falkor. Plugins can be written in any language, as they are simply APIs that serve JSON data.

## Prerequisites

To create a plugin, you need to use a language capable of serving JSON data. While we recommend using Node.js, you are free to use any language you are comfortable with.

## Required Routes

For a plugin to work, the following routes are required:

- `/setup.json`
- `/search/:os/:query`
- `/return/:return`

### `setup.json`

The `setup.json` file is used to configure the plugin. It contains the following fields:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the plugin.
- **version**: The version of the plugin, used to determine compatibility.
- **config**: A boolean indicating whether the plugin has a configuration page. If `true`, the plugin will appear in the settings menu.
- **multiple-choice**: A boolean indicating whether the needs an extra request to get the source. If `true`, additional requests may be needed to fetch source links.
- **name**: The name of the plugin, displayed in the settings menu.
- **description**: A description of the plugin, shown in the settings menu.
- **logo**: A URL to the plugin's logo, displayed in the settings menu.
- **banner**: A URL to the plugin's banner, displayed in the settings menu. (Optional)
- **api_url**: The base URL for the plugin's API, used for making requests.
- **author**: Information about the author of the plugin. (Optional)

#### JSON Response - `setup.json`

```json
{
  "id": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "config": true,
  "multiple-choice": false,
  "name": "Example Plugin",
  "description": "This is an example plugin.",
  "logo": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "banner": "https://example.com/banner.png",
  "api_url": "https://example.com/api",
  "author": {
    "name": "example",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

### `search/:os/:query`

The `search/:os/:query` route is used to fetch games. It takes two parameters:

- `os`: The operating system of the games to search for.
- `query`: The search query to use.

The route should return a JSON array of game objects. Each game object should contain the following fields:

#### JSON Response - `DDL`

```json
[
  {
    "type": "ddl",
    "name": "Example Game",
    "url": "https://example.com/game.exe",
    "size": 1024
  }
]
```

- `type`: The type of game. This should be `ddl` as it is a direct download link.
- `name`: The name of the game.
- `url`: The URL of the game.
- `size`: The size of the game in bytes.

#### JSON Response - `Torrent` or `Magnet`

```json
[
  {
    "type": "torrent",
    "seeds": 100,
    "name": "Example Game",
    "uploader": "example",
    "return": "base64-string",
    "size": 1024
  }
]
```

- `type`: The type of game. This should be either `torrent`, or `magnet`.
- `name`: The name of the game.
- `seeds`: The number of seeds for the game.
- `uploader`: The uploader of the game.
- `return`: The return type of the game. This should be either `base64-string` or `magnet-uri`.
- `size`: The size of the game in bytes.

### `return/:return`

The `return/:return` route is used to fetch the actual torrent. It takes one parameter:

- `return`: The return type of the game. This should be either `base64-string` or `magnet-uri`.

The route should return a JSON ARRAY with the following fields:

#### JSON Response - `return/:return`

```json
["link-to-torrent"]
```

That should be it now you just install the plugin using the setup.json file and the app should use it as intended.
